# Hashing with Mutual Information
This repository contains Matlab implementation of the below papers:

[1] "MIHash: Online Hashing with Mutual Information",
    Fatih Cakir*, Kun He*, Sarah Adel Bargal, and Stan Sclaroff. (* Equal contribution)
    International Conference on Computer Vision (**ICCV**), 2017 ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08919))

[2] "Hashing with Mutual Information",
    Fatih Cakir*, Kun He*, Sarah Adel Bargal, and Stan Sclaroff. (* Equal contribution)
    IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (**TPAMI**) 2019 ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00974))

The repo includes:
- Both online/batch versions of our MIHash method from above paper. :warning: **Note: The batch (deep) learning of MIHash implementation is updated and moved to [deep-mihash](https://github.com/fcakir/deep-mihash).**
- An experimental framework for online hashing methods
- Implementations of several online hashing techniques

## Preparation
- Create or symlink a directory `cachedir` under the main directory to hold experimental results
- Install or symlink [VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/)  at `./vlfeat` (for computing performance metrics)
- Install or symlink [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/) at `./matconvnet` (for batch hashing experiments)
- Download datasets and pretrained models: see `data/README.md`.

## Usage
- In the main folder, run `startup.m`.
- For **online** hashing experiments: `cd online-hashing`, and run `demo_online.m` with appropriate input arguments (see `online-hashing/README.md`).
- For **batch** hashing experiments: `cd batch-hashing`, and run `demo_cifar.m` with appropriate input arguments (see `batch-hashing/README.md`).

## Batch Results
:warning: **This portion of the repo is outdated with inferior results. Please refer to the [new repo](https://github.com/fcakir/deep-mihash) for the latest results for deep/batch learning of MIHash!** 

Here we provide the latest results of MIHash and other competing work on CIFAR-10. For reproducibility, we also provide the parameters for MIHash we used to obtain these results (see `batch-hashing/opts_batch.m`). 

### CIFAR-10
The standard setup for CIFAR-10 has two distinct settings (as specified in the papers DTSH and MIHash). The results shown here uses the VGG-F deep learning architecture and learning is done in an end-to-end fashion. For non-deep methods this corresponds to using the features at the penultimate layer of VGG-F. (Note that differently, in the MIHash paper, we do VGG-16 single-layer experiments for setting-1). 

Please refer to the above papers for details regarding setting 1 and 2.

**NOTE:** These diaries are from older versions of the repo, where different parameter names might be used. By inspection the parameters can easily be matched to `opts_batch.m`. Notably **sigscale** is equal to **sigmf(1)**.
